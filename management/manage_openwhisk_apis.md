# Create APIs from {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} actions
{: #manage_openwhisk_apis}

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} actions can benefit from being managed by API management.

With API management, you can expose a {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} action as an API. After you define the API, you can apply security and rate limiting policies, view API usage and response logs, and define API sharing policies.  

To create an {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} API, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} Dashboard, click the **APIs** tab. If you already have {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} APIs created, then a list of your {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} APIs is displayed. If you do not have any {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} APIs, then a Getting Started screen is displayed. 
2. Click **Create a {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} API**. The Create API for {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} window is displayed. 
3. Complete the fields in the API Info section, and then click **Create Operation**. The Create Operation window is displayed. You create operations to define the endpoint, https path, and method for your API.
4. In the "Create Operation" window, complete the required fields for your {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} operation. The fields that are included in the "Create Operation" window include the following fields:

    * Path - The path to where your API is located. 
    * Verb - The HTTP method for your API. Select from the following methods:
	    * DELETE
		* GET
		* HEAD
		* OPTIONS
		* PATCH
		* POST
		* PUT
	* Package containing action - The packages that are already available in your organization that might have the action that you want to use for this API. See [Using and creating Cloud Functions packages](../../openwhisk/openwhisk_packages.html) for more information about this field.
	* Actions - **Actions that are available in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}** is the only option that is available.
	* Response content type - This identifies the format in which the API returns the information. You can select from the following formats:
	    * application/json - This is the default format, and is the most often used.
		* text/html - This is used for responses that are used on a Web site.
		* text/plain - This is provided in plain text and can be used in comma-separated values files.
		* image/svg+xml - This can be used when screen captures are the main format of responses.
		* Use "Content-Type" header from action - This is dependent on the type of content that is in the header of the response. 
	
5. Select **Create** to create the operation. The Operation is added to the Operations that invoke {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} actions table.
5. Complete the remaining information that you want to complete. You can also add or update the remaining information later when you manage your APIs.
6. Click **Save**. The API management overview page for your API opens and all the information that you just defined is displayed.
7. Continue managing your API with [Manage APIs](manage_apis.html).
