# Enable API managed endpoints

In microservice architecture, Cloud Foundry applications are often deployed to make up the system. Most of these apps will have some sort of API that should be managed.

To begin managing Cloud Foundry APIs, complete the following steps:

1. Go to your Cloud Foundry application.
2. Select **API Management** in the navigation.
3. Select the **Expose Managed API** toggle to turn on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} API Management features. This action inserts the API gateway between the public Internet and your app.
4. Continue managing your API with [Manage APIs](manage_apis.html).
